            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

We may euidently perceiue and as it were palpablye feele, that many gouernours haue their perticuler deuises concerning the K. death, &amp; easilye may we iudge how much they are deceiued, considering the onely iniustice of their conceits doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them, that the apprehension thereof dooth destroye them, and that their consciences do torment them with a scourge, which ingratitude layeth about their shoulders, as an instrument destined to that onely end. I beseech you tell me, what became of the inheritours, not of the desert but of the dominions of great <hi>Alexander?</hi> All the Princes &amp; Lords of <hi>Grece</hi> thought to finde a second life in his first death: but hardly was himselfe buried, before they were all found in their graues: In stead of gaine, reaping nothing but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for a kingdome, the desire of one: for assurance, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire: for a place of retract, the tombe: &amp; for choise from bad to better, onlye death. Such were <hi>Eumenes, Demetrius, Ptolomie, Antigonus, Saleuchus,</hi> of whom some lost both liues &amp; kingdomes, &amp; some endured tribulations more forcible, and torments more cruell and bitter then death. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Poet, semeth to haue some reason, that said:
<q>
                  <l>A Captaine for glory it maye well beseeme,</l>
                  <l>After his conquest still to sutuiue:</l>
                  <l>Or if by fortune men daunted him dee me,</l>
                  <l>In fame of vertue after death to reuiue.</l>

            </p>
            <p>What will become of so many ingratefull Lordes if our prince should miscarie: or what will become euen of the princes themselues, when all obedience is violated, subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on buried, the ambitiÅ of perticuler persons encreased, malice in generall accomplished, and disorder perfected? Among the princes of <hi>Jtaly</hi> some doe acknowledge the empire, and some are of the popes homage: They can encurre no displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure neyther susteine any iniury, but either the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will support them: but who shall protect these men, considering that only one <hi>Charles</hi> the fift triumphed ouer all the princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> within the space of four monthes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176853:4"/> who in effect &amp; apparance had all bene lost, had it not beene for the succour that they receiued from <hi>Henry</hi> the second? If they frame the substance or bodye of an army, who shall be the head? If they haue none, who can fight without a head? But if there be a head, who will endure it, considering they coulde not brooke a lawfull King? And in the meane tyme what shall become of the people? Shall not they be led as beares or bulles by the noses to be the pastimes of the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some <hi>Chastelaine</hi> or warder, in whose forhead tirannie shalbe written with the verie blood of his fellow <hi>Citizens?</hi> yea whereto shall the church be reduced, when euery souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wilbe curat of his owne village, &amp; euery Captaine Byshop of his owne garison? Where I beseech you shall wee finde la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, &amp; due reward for the same? May tirantes rest in sastie, where kinges are debarred that felicitie? will men practize that course toward them which they haue abhorred toward others? Counsailers &amp; PresidÄts should become factionaries to those that liue vnder their iurisdictions: and they that are the protection of kinges should liue vnder the halbarde of some Corporal, or paraduenture of some watchman or scout.</p>
            <p>All this had almost come to passe in the hurt of our King (whom heauen would in our behalfs immortalize, in case our selues were as worthy as his desertes doe bind vs to wish it &amp; our necessitie do inuite vs) His death would haue quailed our libertie: his fall would haue ouerwhelmed our felicitie: his losse would haue made desolate our families: his absence woulde haue acquainted vs with that which wee feare: his ship wrack would haue swallowed vs vp: and the breaking of so great a body would haue bred a rocke in <hi>Europe</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon Saint Peters ship would haue bene quite split and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly wrecked. Beleeue me not my maisters: I woulde to God I might be found a lyer in all that I am to tell you. And this is it: namely that certaine Capucines, Peuilians &amp; other fryers of this towne dare freely confesse that they neuer pray vnto God for the King: because (say they) the pope hath not absolued him: as if it were lawfull for him to condemne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency: to iudge of that which is not in controuersie: &amp; to alienate from Gods grace the person that in such humilitie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:176853:4"/> doth beg it: That surely ther is superstition in this so vaine &amp; presumptuous rigour, considering all counsailes doe mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that it is not the Bull that excommunicateth the man, but the fault: also that the fault is taken away when repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance taketh place, which serueth as a beginning of absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and an end of punishment (my speech is of the same which spirituall Iudges may inflict) why doe they therefore ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to bewitch our soules, by ministring vnto them a food so vnseasonable for a christian, who ought to pardon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence euen before it bee accomplished, and rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and grow bitter against the peruers nature of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuter, then to returne vpon the persecuted: for it is writen: <hi>I will wait vntill the Sunne goe downe, and J will be a light vnto his steps, least he should fall.</hi> The Curates of all parishes do powre foorth their praiers to God for the King: All lawes both of God and man doe ordaine the same: And his benefites doe in generall bind vs thereunto: yet shall these men as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and men guiltie of treason make a diuorce in the church &amp; escape, I wil not say vnpunished, but euÄ vnreproued? The kinges subiectes doe feed them: yea the kinges them selues haue established them: and now shall they vpon some bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous error, togither with a malitious pretence, free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from that duety wherto nature bindeth them and the generall societie of men doth call them? Shall they commit such impietie only in France: because the contempt of the lawes &amp; royal dignitie is so great that the princes are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded but vpÅ humours: neither the laws obserued, but for a fashion, &amp; yet that also rather in aparance thÄ in effect? The simple people whose minde is not capable of any profound reasoning &amp; which beleueth no more then itself imagineth, is incontinently drawen to the purpose of these fryers, who for bread doe preach vnto them a reuolt: terrifying the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker consciences, &amp; shaking the beast founded by I wot not what manner of threatning, which serueth as a torture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout consciences, an ambush to the kings life, trouble to the common wealth, and argument of superstition and offence to the Church, whose iust &amp; holy weapons are neuer emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against such as acknowledge their dueties to her, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnder her standerd are resolued there vnder to fight, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:176853:5"/> to the death. Can any thing be more impertinent or of a more cowardly disposition, then that some of the kings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers who barking at the shadowes of Miters &amp; red hattes with eloquence rather artificiall then naturall &amp; with farther fetches then reason, haue hitherto maintained the Iesuites with such feruency that they enflamed the speches of theyr maisters faithfull seruants &amp; conuerted thÄ into smoke, euÄ at such time as the kings life was in question, &amp; that mÄ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested against them in respect of the smale accompt that they made, to the end they might rest in credite with the pope &amp; his formall creatures the Iesuites? A little thing woulde make me to tearme you the vnthankfull Pyes or layes of this great cadge: I haue couradge enough to vndertake it &amp; more then sufficient argument to put it in effect: But I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare you, for the honor of <hi>France,</hi> as also for that albeit yee escape the hand of man, yet is not Gods hand subiect to any palsey: you shal haue no greater enemies then your selues: &amp; albeit your offices &amp; dignities doe free you from temporall punishment, yet wil men iudge you worthy therof. For the punishment make not the martir but the cause: but it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that your ententes do make you parties, &amp; that al the worlde doth see that you haue wrongfully supported the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, out of whose house as out of an Arcenal or storehouse is issued that accursed piece, who in only one person had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most with lightening kindled al <hi>France</hi> from whÄce al <hi>Europe</hi> should haue bene set in combustion &amp; in such vniuersall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation your selues (as I think) haue bene brought into ruine. yet doth one thing put me in comfort &amp; make mee to hope wel: namely that our maisters of <hi>Paris</hi> haue in this last essay of treason made full proofe of their fidelitie.

The salutations by bonfyers &amp; praiers, in that respect powred foorth, do induce a perpetual obliuion of al former transgressiÅs of the enhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Paris,</hi> who in one onely might haue made a perfect day of that credit which his maiesty is to take of their seruice, wherein affection sitteth as president, with so much truthe, that the testimonie therof is wonderfull, &amp; the hope of their continuance certaine and infallible.</p>
